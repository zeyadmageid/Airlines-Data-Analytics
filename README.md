## About

This project entails an in-depth scrutiny of database pertaining to Airlines data. Our objective is to meticulously analyze the database and explore information regarding aircrafts, profits, sales, and occupancy rate. In conclusion, airlines can maximize profitability by analyzing revenue data and making informed decisions. Factors such as total revenue, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft play a crucial role in this analysis. By identifying areas for improvement, adjusting pricing strategies, and optimizing routes, airlines can increase their profitability. However, it's important for airlines to consider consumer happiness and safety while striving for profit. Balancing these factors is key to long-term success in the competitive airline industry. Adopting a data-driven approach to revenue analysis and optimization can lead to sustainable growth and success.

## Getting Started

Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abrarhossainhimself/understat-data-for-teams-players-2014-present

Download the data set which is a zip file containing a csv file for each season which contains a file each team. After extracting the zip file and uploading it to your notebook (in my case I used google drive), everything else will be taken care of. The first section of cells combines together all the csv files for the teams across all seaons into one main spreadsheet. 

### Prerequisites

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- glob
- google.colab
- plotly
  
### Installation

Make sure the libraries above are installed before running the notebook in the following format "!pip install library_name. For example, installing pandas would be: !pip install pandas

## Usage

This project could be used to print season statistics, study the correlation nature between different metrics, and analyze the effect of managers on their clubs before and after their tenure.
